    <p id="first">cultivation, in agriculture and horticulture, the loosening and breaking up (tilling) of the soil
        or, more generally, the raising of crops. The soil around existing plants is cultivated—by hand using a hoe or
        by machine using a cultivator—to destroy weeds and promote growth by increasing soil aeration and water
        infiltration. Soil being prepared for the planting of a crop is cultivated by a harrow or plow. Numerous systems
        have been developed for the cultivation of crops in the long history of agriculture, including terrace
        cultivation, agroforestry, crop rotation, shifting agriculture, and others. For more information about the
        cultivation of soil, see tillage.

        <p>Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,[c]
            and nearly colorless chemical substance. It is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of
            all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[20]). It is vital for all known forms of life,
            despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each
            of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms
            are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45Â°.[21] In liquid form, H2O is also called "water" at
            standard temperature and pressure.</p>
